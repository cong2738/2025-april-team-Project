DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP u_GP_calculator/U_calculator/RESULT0 output u_GP_calculator/U_calculator/RESULT0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP u_GP_calculator/U_calculator/RESULT0__0 output u_GP_calculator/U_calculator/RESULT0__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.

MREG Output pipelining  
DSP u_GP_calculator/U_calculator/RESULT0 multiplier stage u_GP_calculator/U_calculator/RESULT0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net u_GP_UART/u_uart/U_Tx/temp_data_next__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin u_GP_UART/u_uart/U_Tx/temp_data_next_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell u_GP_UART/u_uart/U_Tx/temp_data_next_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.

REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 U_RAM/mem_reg has an input control pin U_RAM/mem_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: U_RAM/mem_reg_0[5]) which is driven by a register (U_APB_Master/temp_addr_reg_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
